## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to abortion rights and abortion access. I would like to look into data that explores rates of abortion before and after the Roe v. Wade overturning. Additionally I want to look into racial and ethnic differences in access as well as the role that age and socio-economic status plays.
